# We're getting married!

We're gettimg married **7/25/2021** in **Costa Rica.** If you're reading this you are probably invited and have lots of questions.  We have put together this site to help answer questions (but feel free to reach out to either of us if anything isn't covered).

We took a trip to Costa Rica from 12/25/2020 - 1/7/2021 to gather some info and get familiar with the country.  You'll find some facts about Costa Rica, some info about traveling during Covid, and some fun things we did on our "recon" trip.
