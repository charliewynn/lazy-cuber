With a new cube I usually try to fumble around until I get to one layer with just a few unsolved pieces. I rinse and repeat until I can get to a common roadblock. Sometimes you can get lucky and get to a solve from there. From there I'll note all of the pieces and try an algorithm from a similar cube to see if that helps move the remaining pieces around. If that doesn't work I'll try random new algorithms that "feel" like they might swap the remaining pieces around in a predictable way.

The remaining algorithm(s) will usually only work in a few situations. But using [Communtators](https://youtu.be/7LTCEyrQk44) or [Congugates](https://youtu.be/3WLb0VddFNg) you can usually transform the algorithm into something useful for your situation.
