#Covid in Costa Rica

**Masks are required everywhere.** Including outside.

The population of Costa Rica is just under 5 million, the same as Alabama. But with half the cases and half the deaths as of today.

You will see a few people without masks. But it doesn't compare to the US.  Our first airBNB had a $75 fine for being in the hallways without a mask.

We flew on Christmas Day and were disappointed with the planes and airports (DFW, Ft. Lauderdale, and San José were all pretty bad). We had heard flying wasn't •that• bad but would not fly again for a few months. We feel confident by the time we all head back for the wedding the vaccine will have made things much better.

Being in Costa Rica feels much safer than the US (well Oklahoma at least). Everyone is being very careful. Many stores will not let you inside unless they watch you hand sanitize (sometimes they spray your hands for you). Restaurants have every other table marked off.
