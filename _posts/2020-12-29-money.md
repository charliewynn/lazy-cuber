#Money  

  Costa Rica uses Colones ₡.  600₡ is about $1 USD. Just remember 3000₡ = $5 and 6000₡ = $10.
  
  **USD is accepted essentially everywhere.** Locals were somewhat suspicious about accepting bigger bills. A store clerk usually asks a manager to approve it. **We recomend bringing $20 bills or smaller.**  
  In general we used a Visa card (check to see if you need to add a travel notification to your card). Also check for foreign transaction fees on your card. My Amazon Prime card didn't require a travel notification and has no foreign transaction fee (if you have one I would use that for the most part).
  Maybe 1/10 vendors wouldn't take that card so we would pay with cash in USD. They will give you change in Colones.
  
#Tips
  
  Tips are included in your bill at restaurants (10% flat rate). You do not need to sign anything, after you swipe your card you can leave.
  
  A sit down entree is tipically around $10. Which is honestly a little expensive for Central America, but on par with Oklahoma prices.  Groceries are inexpensive, we cooked about half of our meals here.
