# Why Lazy Cubing

Solving "twisty puzzles" is a trade off between the (number of turns) and (number of algorithms) needed. This is true for both figuring out a new cube for the first time and for creating a reproducible set of steps to follow.

Some people memorize over a hundred algorithms for a 3x3x3 (standard Rubik's cube). I think an argument can be made that if you exclude "intuitive" algorithms you only need 3-4 "real" algorithms to solve one. The 3-4 algorithm method won't win you any prizes but for me it's more fun to figure out the minimum amount of steps.
